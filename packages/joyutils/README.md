> Elegent & utility methods to facilitate common usage in JavaScript!

### Why named export?

1. Module is a namespace. Default export often leads to function/component per file dogma and makes code less maintainable.
2. Interop with commonjs is broken in many cases or hard to maintain.
3. Show me any good language with default exports. It's historical javascriptism.
